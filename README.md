### 1、Brief Introduction

The instant messaging platform enables people far apart to conveniently communicate, enhancing their quality of life and work efficiency. After gaining a comprehensive understanding of user needs, the “talk later” platform was meticulously designed and divided into two components: the APP client end and the system management background. This architecture adopts a front-end and back-end separation approach.

The project encompasses three main components: the development of the APP client utilizing H5+ and MUI technologies, the system management background development based on VUE and ElementUI, and the system service support built on SpringBoot + WebSocket. The chat back system’s APP terminal not only facilitates the management of sessions, friend information, and personal details but also provides reliable and efficient communication services to its users. After undergoing rigorous testing, the system has successfully achieved its intended design objectives.
